    Today's Date & Time:
    <input type="text" id="currentDateTime">
<br><br>
<script>
  var today = new Date();
var date = today.getFullYear()+'-'+(today.getMonth()+1)+'-'+today.getDate();
var time = today.getHours() + ":" + today.getMinutes() + ":" + today.getSeconds();
var dateTime = date+' '+time;

    <p><strong>Production Function</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>It shows the relationship between the quantity of labor and the total product.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Marginal Product:</strong> It's the amount of product gained of production of hiring one more worker. Creating the formula as (Change in Total Product/Change in Quantity Labor)</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Law of Diminishing Returns</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>As you hire more worker, the firm will gain off getting more products in the production, this is <strong>Increasing returns. </strong> 
      However, as you hire more workers, the total product will start slowly gaining product now, it's still gaining more product as you hire more workers, but at a decreasing rate now, this is called <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>
    When the firm keeps hiring more worker from there, it will reach <strong>Negative Returns</strong> creating less in total product when you hire more workers, making the workplace overwhelmed. It's now not even worth to hire more workers.</p>

    <p>This is how it looks like on a graph form.</p>
    <br>

    </figure>
    <p>These are the three phases in the graph. As you hire more workers in the beginning, marginal product increases. But, it will soon set into the diminishing returns and marginal product begins to fall, <strong>THIS DOESN'T MEAN IT'S HIRING WORKERS AT A LOSS YET.</strong> Finally, you set in to the negative returns where you lose products when you hire more workers now.</p>
