    <h2>Demand</h2>

    <p><strong>The law of Demand</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Ceteris Paribus:</strong> The consumers buy more at the low prices and less at high prices. That means that will create the demand curve downward sloping.</p>

    <p><strong>Price does not change the demand. Price will change the quantity demanded.</strong> It will change the quantity demanded by moving along the curve. </p>
<br>
    <p><strong>Demand Shifters</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1. Tastes and preferences</strong> When there's an increase in consumer taste, the demand curve will shift to the right, an increase in demand. But, if the trend dies, the demand curve will shift to the left.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>2. Market size</strong> If there is more buyers in the market, there will be an increase in demand, vice versa.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>3. Prices of related goods</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Substitutes:</strong> When the price of related good goes up, the demand of the other good goes up. An example can be like apple and oranges.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Complements:</strong> When the price of related good goes up, the demand of the other good goes down. An example can be like batteries and a flashlight.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>4. Changes of Income</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
    When people gain more income, they buy more shoes in an example, which makes an increase in demand for <strong>normal goods.</strong>
  <br>
  When people gain more income, they buy less of a canned foods in an example, which makes a decrease for <strong>inferior goods.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>5. Expectations of change in price</strong> If the consumer thinks the product will have a decrease in price, the consumer will decrease demand and then buy more later, vice versa.</p>

  <p>An increase in the demand curve looks like this</p>
    <button onClick="window.location.reload();">Increase in Demand</button>
    <p>When the demand curve shifts to the right, meaning there is a higher quantity demanded at all avaliable prices.</p>

    <p>A decrease in the demand curve looks like this</p>
    <button onClick="window.location.reload();">Decrease in Demand</button> 
    <br>
    <p><strong>Why are demand curves downward sloping?</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>It's because of the <strong>substitution effect.</strong> This tells us that an increase in price makes substitutes more attractive for the consumer to buy, which makes a decrease in price less attractive on other substitutes. For example if Pepsi was much expensive than Coke, you would have less desire on Pepsi and go buy more Coke. </p>
    <p>Another reason is called, <strong>Income effect. </strong>An increase in price decreases the purchasing power of consumers and vice versa. If you have a purchasing power of $20, and pepsi is $10, you can only buy 2 Pepsi, however if the price decreases to $5, you buy 4 Pepsi. </p>
