    <p>Microeconomic is about how to effeciently use the scarcity we have within our society, how and why various goods have diverse values, how people and businesses accompany and benefit from efficient production and trade, and how individuals best coordinate. Generally speaking, microeconomics provides a more fully detailed understanding than macroeconomics. I have taken AP microeconomics which are very beneficial how money moves within the society. I took the exam only by studying by myself to go through the concepts with internet. These are one of the best websites that helped me out on learning microeconomics significantly.</p>

  <p>There is a website called Fiveable too to learn indepth where reviewecon/khanacademy might not cover on. Fiveable doesn't only have macro/micro economics courses to study, it has other courses other too.</p>

<p>Also, the graphs are super useful in this course, and it will give you some questions based on graphs in the free response questions that are tough. </p>
    
<br>
    
<p>If you are familiar with an app called "Discord", feel free to join this group chat. It's a great place to ask your questions (There's teachers that can help you in any AP courses!) You can also join study sessions with other people and communicate in depth of AP exams or interests you are into. I also talk about AP computer programming principles exam or AP Physics 1 or C for my next year. I ask multiple questions that I need some help with understanding.</p>

<p>It's great to ask people some questions you might don't know. But it's hard to get good questions that will help you practice and learn throughout in a self-learning exam. I suggest you to solve some free response questions in the collegeboard which the questions are from the past economic exams. Here is the link for the past economic exam questions (The free response questions are always the hardest to answer).</p>

<p>Once, you're done reviewing after you cover the whole AP units of microeconomics, make sure to watch the videos on this channel for a last final review. It really helps when you watch this a day before for a nice refresh on the brain. It's not easy to keep in mind with all how the graphs work, the graph is much complex then AP Macroeconomic course. Check out the link below for more videos than Unit 1 review.</p>

<p>Here is the link to his channel, make sure to review all units before the exam.</p>

<br>

<p>Here is another video that you might find useful watching before the exam. It'll basically cover all the complex graphs briefly and quickly. Refresh with this amazing videos.</p>

<br>
<p>These are all the websites/videos to help myself to get a decent job on doing AP micro/macro economics exam (Didn't do so good on Macro). It's a hard challenge to take these AP courses by self-studying. I'm planning to do the same thing for AP Computer Science Principles, AP Physics 1 and AP Physics C. (Might take more AP science exams if I'm more flexible onto my Grade 12 schedule next year) Have fun studying microeconomic, it's really fun, and useful to know. I hope you get that 5 to show off on your transcript. :)</p>

<h2><strong>Basic Concept</strong></h2>

<p>Microeconomics is a study of how individuals, households, and firms make decisions and allocate resources. For example, whether a high school graduate chooses to go to college or directly into the workforce is a microeconomic decision.(Opportunity cost)</p>

<p>Economic is about 5 key components: <strong>Scarcity, Resources, Choices, Three essential economic questions and Economic Systems. </strong></p>
    
<h2>Scarcity</h2>

<p>Scarcity is the fundamental problem. Humanity don't have everything we want. For example, you wanted the nike good shoe, but it's already sold out. Scarcity is our inability of having unlimited resources to satisfy everyone. 
If the product is scarce, we can estimate that the product has a positive price, less avaliable than wanted and having opportunity cost. 
</p>

<p><strong>The factors of production: Land, Labor, Human Capital and Entrepreneurship.</strong> These are required to create products through production. (entrepreneurship means a person or a firm taking a risk to gain profit in the market)</p>

<h2>Economic Systems</h2>

<p><strong>Basic Economic Questions:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. What are you gonna produce?</strong> There is limited amount of resourses within scarcity, it should be cafually chosen to know what to produce by using those limited amount of resourses. This question helps the firm to think which would the product be helpful for people in the market. For example, if there's a lot of water bottle companies, you don't have to go for a water firm. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. How to produce?</strong> You could choose to put more human capital onto machines rather than human labor or vice versa. This question helps the firm to produce the product more efficiently.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>3. For whom to produce?</strong> Who gets the products? How will it be distributed out in the market? This question will help the firm to create an allocatively efficient production.</p> 
<br>
<p><strong>Type of Economies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Command Economy</strong> The central planners choose deciding the three basic economic questions, you could see this economy in North Korea.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Market Economy</strong> Individuals in the society decide whether to buy or sell within the market. The individuals decide the three basic economic questions.</p>
<br>
<h2>Opportunity Cost</h2>
<br>
<p>The opportunity cost is the value of cost that the next best alternative choice was not chosen. It's the cost of choice, not being able to choose the next best choice. For example, you can go into university after a graduation of highschool, then the opportunity cost of that choice could be like working and gaining salary rather than going to the university.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Two Types of cost</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explicit cost:</strong> It's the money that cost in a money wise. The cost that you pay with human capital.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Implicit cost:</strong> It's opportunity cost, that you lose from making a choice.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, if a person was working at a superstore for $400 per day and quit that job to create his own superstore by paying $200 and makes $500 in revenue per day. </p>
<br>
<p>The Explicit cost of creating superstore would be $200 and the implicit cost would be $400 in this way. So, if you compare this with these costs to the revenue that are made, it makes an accounting profit, but makes a loss according to the economic profit.</p>
